There are StringIndexOutofBoundEXceptions because of possibly me not knowing how
address the first line of the text file. This however may also be due to the text
file itself. This problem leads to more complications and I am unsure what the 
code is like without errors (no full debug). I couldn't actually debug the whole
program so I am sure there are also issues with numbers like substrings and array 
sizes. Initiating arrays also confused me and I was unsure how to approach this in
terms of initially setting the size of the array. I am unsure which ones of these
issues contributed to the error I am having upfront but there are bound to be errors
behind it.
